## Work Experiences
            
- [2013.9 - Now]
    * Company: Intel Mobile Communication (Beijing)
    * Team: Test Utilities Team, it's a global team whose members are from worldwide like German, America, India, China. My manager is Germany.
    * Position: Intel Modem Chip Automation Testing Development Engineer
    * Team Job Description:         
        + Develop and maintain Automation Testing Framework/System and testing Servers in Java and Python. This testing framework is used by field test engineers to run testing outside.
        + Design hardware and software solutions for the framework/system.  
        + The testing framework was run offline at first because our testing scenario is in field not in lab/office. Later we upgraded it to support for running testing online via AWS platform. In this way, we can upload testing results back to office in real time when running testing in field.
        + And we also develop a website using Django to schedule testing.
    * Personal Job Description:
        + Participate in developing and maintaining the Automation Testing Framework/System
        + For the online part of the framework/system, I'm charge of the AWS platform part, because our testing is in field, we need sync the testing data back to Intel office. So we use AWS platform as intermediary.
        + I contributed codes to the Django based schedule testing website. Now it's managed by a stand alone team.
        + I create and maintain testing servers with AWS EC2 instances.
        + I develop many tools components for the framework.
